# Project Title - Donation Campaign

This is a React based web project where we can donate on ongoing donation campaigns. In this project we can donate up to 4 types of donation categories and each of the donation campaigns can only be donated once. Their is a donation details page upon clicking the campaigns and statistics page to see donation results. 

## Some of the Features of the project:
- Responsiveness
- Dynamic data load
- Duplicate donation detection(Users cant donate in a campaign more than 1 time)

## Detailed Features:
- Toast: To identify which donation campaigns are already donated or not , I added toast feature. It will show if any donation is successful upon donating and alert if their is already any donation made on that campaign.
- Pie Chart : To show donation details and how many donation can be made , Their is a pie chart in the statistics page. It will make things easier to see if how many more donations can be made. 
- Show All Button : Their is a button on Donation page which will appear if total number of donation exceeds 4. The donation page will show first 4 donations made in default and upon clicking on Show all, other donations will be shown. To get back to previous state their is also a show less button which replaces show all button after click .
